# Remake of a popular gym's mobile app

A remake of a gym app with focus on accessibility using React and React router designed for mobile only

## The Process

Special care was taken to ensure the app is completely accessible to all users:
</br>
- All colour contrast and font size is according to WCAG guidelines
- Space has been added between clickable links for easier scrolling by users with motor function disabilities
- Elements are semantically named and labeled to make screen reader use easier and understandable
- Letter spacing is increased and first letters of words capitalized for dyslexic users
</br>
 Design was done similar to the gym's current design system, however logo and name has been omitted. </br>

## Running the app

The project was bootstrapped with create-react-app</br>
To run the project you run this command in the project directory:

### `npm start`

You will need node package manager installed in the directory before running. </br>
